What it's not:
 * Outside-in vs Inside-out TDD
 * DDD
 * Top-down vs bottom-up
 
Issues to reference:
 * Pattern abuse
 * Missing the domain
 * Building programs from the requirement and not from how see the requirement
 * We tend to immediately pigeonhole problems into familiar patterns - this is bad and causes bad abstractions (pattern-driven rather than domain-driven)
